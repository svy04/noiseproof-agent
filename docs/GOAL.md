# NoiseProof Agent Goal

Future agents should be able to continue the project by reading this file first, inspecting the current repository state, and executing the next highest-value gate without needing a new day-by-day prompt.

## 1. Top-level Purpose

NoiseProof Agent is a noise-resilient data agent for messy market intelligence.

It should prove that a small service can ingest messy market documents and web data, profile source quality, compare chunking and retrieval behavior, record evidence, surface contradictions, block unsupported claims, and generate claim-bounded reports with citations.

The hiring narrative is:

- Primary target: Braincrew Forward Deployed Engineer
- Secondary / long-term target: Braincrew Product Engineer

The project should show customer-like problem definition, service architecture, RAG/Agent workflow judgment, operational logging, failure records, and technical decision documentation.

## 2. Absolute Non-goals

NoiseProof Agent is not a trading bot.

Do not build:

- buy/sell signals
- automatic order execution
- target prices
- return prediction
- stock recommendations
- financial advice
- real-time trading infrastructure
- reinforcement-learning trader
- multi-tenant SaaS v1
- polished UI before logs, failure cases, and evidence behavior exist

If a request drifts toward trading advice, reframe it into evidence-based market intelligence:

- What happened?
- What evidence supports it?
- Which sources conflict?
- Which claims are weak?
- What data is missing?
- Why should this conclusion not be trusted yet?

## 3. Current Accepted State

Accepted state as of Phase 6:

## 4. How Future Agents Continue

Every continuation agent must:

1. Read this file first.
2. Inspect the repository state.
3. Determine the next incomplete phase from the phase ladder.
4. Implement only that gate.
5. Update tests, `README.md`, `docs/runbook.md`, and relevant docs.
6. Run available verification commands.
7. Commit with a phase-specific message.
8. Report what is implemented, what remains planned, tests run, tests not run and why, and the next recommended gate.

Do not skip gates.
Do not make the project more impressive than it is.
Make it easier to inspect what works, what fails, what is blocked, and what remains unproven.

## 5. Phase Ladder

```text
Phase 0   - Documentation-first package
Phase 1   - Service skeleton and metadata persistence
Phase 1.5 - Runtime persistence verification
Phase 2   - Ingestion fixtures and Document Profiler v0
Phase 3   - Parser adapter stubs
Phase 4   - Chunk strategy experiment v0
Phase 5   - Retrieval v0
Phase 5.5 - Collection Plan Preview v0
Phase 6   - Evidence Ledger v0
Phase 7   - Critic / Noise Gate v0
Phase 8   - Claim-bounded report v0
Phase 9   - Operations dashboard v0
Phase 10  - Evaluation and application package
```

### Phase 1.5 - Runtime Persistence Verification

If Docker is available, verify:

```bash
docker compose config
docker compose up -d db
docker compose ps
cd apps/api
uv sync
uv run uvicorn app.main:app --reload
```

Then call:

```bash
curl http://localhost:8000/health
curl http://localhost:8000/ops/summary
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/documents ...
curl http://localhost:8000/documents
```

If Docker is not available, report:

```text
Docker runtime verification was not performed in this environment.
```

Do not pretend runtime persistence was verified when it was not.

### Phase 2 - Ingestion Fixtures and Document Profiler v0

Required outputs:

```text
examples/messy-market-data/README.md
examples/messy-market-data/sample-note.md
examples/messy-market-data/sample-market.csv
examples/messy-market-data/sample-report.txt
examples/messy-market-data/sample-page.html
packages/ingestion/__init__.py
packages/ingestion/types.py
packages/ingestion/profiler.py
apps/api/app/services/document_profiler.py
```

Preferred API:

```text
POST /documents/profile
```

Profile fields:

```text
source_type
character_count
line_count
approximate_token_count
has_tables
has_urls
has_dates
has_numbers
extraction_quality
recommended_strategy
warnings
```

Phase 2 should not parse files from uploads. It profiles provided text or fixture-like content only.

### Phase 3 - Parser Adapter Stubs

Implemented outputs:

```text
packages/ingestion/parsers/__init__.py
packages/ingestion/parsers/base.py
packages/ingestion/parsers/markdown.py
packages/ingestion/parsers/csv.py
packages/ingestion/parsers/html.py
packages/ingestion/parsers/pdf.py
packages/ingestion/selector.py
apps/api/app/services/parse_preview.py
POST /documents/parse-preview
```

Parse-preview accepts direct text payloads and returns:

```text
source_type
parser
text
metadata
warnings
failure_case_candidate
profile
```

The PDF parser is currently a text-only fallback. Robust PDF extraction is not claimed.

### Phase 4 - Chunk Strategy Experiment v0

Implemented outputs:

```text
packages/ingestion/chunking/__init__.py
packages/ingestion/chunking/experiment.py
apps/api/app/services/chunk_preview.py
POST /documents/chunk-preview
```

Chunk-preview accepts direct text payloads and returns:

```text
source_type
parser
profile
parse_warnings
failure_case_candidate
strategies
```

Implemented strategies:

```text
fixed-window
heading-aware
row-aware
```

Phase 4 does not persist chunks, run retrieval, compute embeddings, generate Evidence Ledger entries, call LLMs, or build a dashboard.

Current local `docs/GOAL.md` does not include a separate `Parallel research track` section. Phase 4 research influence is intentionally limited to strategy names and comparison metrics.

### Phase 5 - Retrieval v0

Implemented outputs:

```text
packages/ingestion/retrieval/__init__.py
packages/ingestion/retrieval/lexical.py
apps/api/app/services/retrieval_run.py
apps/api/app/routes/retrieval_runs.py
POST /retrieval-runs
GET /retrieval-runs
```

Retrieval v0 accepts direct text sources and returns:

```text
id
question
strategy
status
latency_ms
result_count
hit_rate
citation_coverage
missing_evidence_count
metadata_json
created_at
results
warnings
```

Each result includes:

```text
source_id
source_type
chunk_strategy
chunk_index
text
score
matched_terms
metadata
```

Phase 5 does not persist chunks, compute embeddings, create Evidence Ledger entries, call LLMs, generate final answers, create reports, run a Critic / Noise Gate, or build a dashboard.

### Phase 5.5 - Collection Plan Preview v0

Implemented outputs:

```text
packages/ingestion/collection/__init__.py
packages/ingestion/collection/planner.py
apps/api/app/services/collection_plan.py
apps/api/app/routes/collection_plans.py
POST /collection-plans/preview
```

Collection Plan Preview accepts a question and returns:

```text
question
information_need
possible_claims
required_roles
source_types_to_check
minimum_evidence_needed
known_risks
stop_conditions
warnings
```

Implemented role examples:

```text
direct_support
contradiction
quantitative_anchor
timeline_anchor
definition_anchor
source_quality_check
missing_data_signal
scope_boundary
user_intent_check
```

Phase 5.5 is a deterministic preview boundary. It does not call LLMs, search external sources, expand retrieval, create Evidence Ledger entries, run a Critic / Noise Gate, generate final answers, create reports, build a dashboard, or persist collection plans.

### Phase 6 - Evidence Ledger Preview v0

Implemented outputs:

```text
packages/ingestion/evidence/__init__.py
packages/ingestion/evidence/ledger.py
apps/api/app/services/evidence_ledger.py
apps/api/app/routes/evidence_ledgers.py
POST /evidence-ledgers/preview
```

Evidence Ledger Preview accepts a question and direct retrieval candidates, then returns:

```text
question
entries
summary
warnings
```

Each entry includes:

```text
claim
source_id
source_type
source_date
evidence_span
confidence
limitation
contradicting_source_ids
status
matched_terms
role
```

Implemented statuses:

```text
supported
weakly_supported
contradicted
unsupported
blocked
```

Phase 6 is a deterministic preview boundary. It does not call LLMs, search external sources, persist Evidence Ledger entries, run a Critic / Noise Gate, generate final answers, create reports, or build a dashboard.

Next recommended implementation phase:

```text
Phase 7 - Critic / Noise Gate v0
```

## 6. Ordering Rules

Do not implement embeddings before profiler exists.
Do not implement retrieval before chunk strategy exists.
Do not implement report generation before Evidence Ledger exists.
Do not build a dashboard before logs and failures exist.
Do not polish UI before the system has inspectable failure behavior.

## 7. Testing Rules

Every phase must add or update tests for the new boundary.

Minimum checks:

- `uv run python -m compileall app` from `apps/api`
- `uv run pytest -q` from `apps/api`
- schema or fixture checks when relevant
- Docker checks only when Docker is available

If a verification command cannot run in the environment, report the exact reason.

## 8. Documentation Rules

When a phase changes the system, update:

- `README.md`
- `docs/runbook.md`
- relevant architecture or evaluation docs

Always distinguish:

- implemented
- planned
- unverified

## 9. Commit and Report Rules

Use phase-specific commit messages, for example:

```text
docs: add project goal and continuation gates
feat: add document profiler v0
feat: add parser adapter stubs
feat: add chunk strategy experiment v0
```

Final report must include:

- commit hash
- what is implemented
- what remains planned
- tests run
- tests not run and why
- next recommended gate

## 10. Application-ready Definition

NoiseProof Agent is application-ready only when:

- local Docker Compose stack runs
- at least PDF, CSV, URL/HTML, and markdown memo inputs are supported
- document profile is generated
- three chunk strategies can be compared
- retrieval returns source ids
- Evidence Ledger can be generated before final answer
- unsupported claims are blocked
- contradictions are surfaced
- buy/sell recommendation questions are refused or reframed
- each agent run leaves a trace
- failure cases are recorded
- operations dashboard shows runs and failures
- README is understandable without explanation
- architecture and ADRs exist
- evaluation report exists
- Braincrew role map exists

Until then, report progress as phased evidence, not product completion.
