# NoiseProof Agent Goal

Future agents should be able to continue the project by reading this file first, inspecting the current repository state, and executing the next highest-value gate without needing a new day-by-day prompt.

## 1. Top-level Purpose

NoiseProof Agent is a noise-resilient data agent for messy market intelligence.

It should prove that a small service can ingest messy market documents and web data, profile source quality, compare chunking and retrieval behavior, record evidence, surface contradictions, block unsupported claims, and generate claim-bounded reports with citations.

The hiring narrative is:

- Primary target: Braincrew Forward Deployed Engineer
- Secondary / long-term target: Braincrew Product Engineer

The project should show customer-like problem definition, service architecture, RAG/Agent workflow judgment, operational logging, failure records, and technical decision documentation.

## 2. Absolute Non-goals

NoiseProof Agent is not a trading bot.

Do not build:

- buy/sell signals
- automatic order execution
- target prices
- return prediction
- stock recommendations
- financial advice
- real-time trading infrastructure
- reinforcement-learning trader
- multi-tenant SaaS v1
- polished UI before logs, failure cases, and evidence behavior exist

If a request drifts toward trading advice, reframe it into evidence-based market intelligence:

- What happened?
- What evidence supports it?
- Which sources conflict?
- Which claims are weak?
- What data is missing?
- Why should this conclusion not be trusted yet?

## 3. Current Accepted State

Accepted state as of Phase 2:

```text
Ingestion Fixtures and Document Profiler v0
```

Implemented:

- FastAPI app skeleton
- `GET /health`
- `GET /ops/summary`
- metadata persistence routes for documents, agent runs, and failure cases
- PostgreSQL init schema for `documents`, `agent_runs`, and `failure_cases`
- `pgcrypto` and `vector` extension init
- Docker Compose DB service definition
- GitHub Actions API smoke CI
- runbook
- `docs/GOAL.md` continuation source of truth
- messy market data fixtures
- reusable `packages/ingestion` profiler package
- `POST /documents/profile`
- Document Profiler v0 fields:
  - source type
  - character count
  - line count
  - approximate token count
  - table, URL, date, and number detection
  - extraction quality
  - recommended strategy
  - warnings

Not yet implemented:

- runtime Docker DB verification in this local environment
- file upload
- file parsing
- chunking
- embeddings
- retrieval
- Evidence Ledger generation
- Critic / Noise Gate
- final report generation
- web dashboard

## 4. How Future Agents Continue

Every continuation agent must:

1. Read this file first.
2. Inspect the repository state.
3. Determine the next incomplete phase from the phase ladder.
4. Implement only that gate.
5. Update tests, `README.md`, `docs/runbook.md`, and relevant docs.
6. Run available verification commands.
7. Commit with a phase-specific message.
8. Report what is implemented, what remains planned, tests run, tests not run and why, and the next recommended gate.

Do not skip gates.
Do not make the project more impressive than it is.
Make it easier to inspect what works, what fails, what is blocked, and what remains unproven.

## 5. Phase Ladder

```text
Phase 0   - Documentation-first package
Phase 1   - Service skeleton and metadata persistence
Phase 1.5 - Runtime persistence verification
Phase 2   - Ingestion fixtures and Document Profiler v0
Phase 3   - Parser adapter stubs
Phase 4   - Chunk strategy experiment v0
Phase 5   - Retrieval v0
Phase 6   - Evidence Ledger v0
Phase 7   - Critic / Noise Gate v0
Phase 8   - Claim-bounded report v0
Phase 9   - Operations dashboard v0
Phase 10  - Evaluation and application package
```

### Phase 1.5 - Runtime Persistence Verification

If Docker is available, verify:

```bash
docker compose config
docker compose up -d db
docker compose ps
cd apps/api
uv sync
uv run uvicorn app.main:app --reload
```

Then call:

```bash
curl http://localhost:8000/health
curl http://localhost:8000/ops/summary
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/documents ...
curl http://localhost:8000/documents
```

If Docker is not available, report:

```text
Docker runtime verification was not performed in this environment.
```

Do not pretend runtime persistence was verified when it was not.

### Phase 2 - Ingestion Fixtures and Document Profiler v0

Required outputs:

```text
examples/messy-market-data/README.md
examples/messy-market-data/sample-note.md
examples/messy-market-data/sample-market.csv
examples/messy-market-data/sample-report.txt
examples/messy-market-data/sample-page.html
packages/ingestion/__init__.py
packages/ingestion/types.py
packages/ingestion/profiler.py
apps/api/app/services/document_profiler.py
```

Preferred API:

```text
POST /documents/profile
```

Profile fields:

```text
source_type
character_count
line_count
approximate_token_count
has_tables
has_urls
has_dates
has_numbers
extraction_quality
recommended_strategy
warnings
```

Phase 2 should not parse files from uploads. It profiles provided text or fixture-like content only.

## 6. Ordering Rules

Do not implement embeddings before profiler exists.
Do not implement retrieval before chunk strategy exists.
Do not implement report generation before Evidence Ledger exists.
Do not build a dashboard before logs and failures exist.
Do not polish UI before the system has inspectable failure behavior.

## 7. Testing Rules

Every phase must add or update tests for the new boundary.

Minimum checks:

- `uv run python -m compileall app` from `apps/api`
- `uv run pytest -q` from `apps/api`
- schema or fixture checks when relevant
- Docker checks only when Docker is available

If a verification command cannot run in the environment, report the exact reason.

## 8. Documentation Rules

When a phase changes the system, update:

- `README.md`
- `docs/runbook.md`
- relevant architecture or evaluation docs

Always distinguish:

- implemented
- planned
- unverified

## 9. Commit and Report Rules

Use phase-specific commit messages, for example:

```text
docs: add project goal and continuation gates
feat: add document profiler v0
feat: add parser adapter stubs
feat: add chunk strategy experiment v0
```

Final report must include:

- commit hash
- what is implemented
- what remains planned
- tests run
- tests not run and why
- next recommended gate

## 10. Application-ready Definition

NoiseProof Agent is application-ready only when:

- local Docker Compose stack runs
- at least PDF, CSV, URL/HTML, and markdown memo inputs are supported
- document profile is generated
- three chunk strategies can be compared
- retrieval returns source ids
- Evidence Ledger can be generated before final answer
- unsupported claims are blocked
- contradictions are surfaced
- buy/sell recommendation questions are refused or reframed
- each agent run leaves a trace
- failure cases are recorded
- operations dashboard shows runs and failures
- README is understandable without explanation
- architecture and ADRs exist
- evaluation report exists
- Braincrew role map exists

Until then, report progress as phased evidence, not product completion.
